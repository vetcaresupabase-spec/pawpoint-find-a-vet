# ✅ Exceptions Integrated with Booking System!

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

The clinic exceptions (closed days + special hours) are now **fully integrated** with the pet owner booking calendar. Pet owners **cannot book** appointments during:
1. **Closed days** (full day closures)
2. **Outside special hours** (when vet has limited hours)

---

## 🎨 Visual Changes on Booking Page

### 1. **Closed Day Display**
```
┌──────────────────┐
│   Thursday       │
│   Nov 02         │
│   ┌─────────┐    │
│   │ Closed  │    │ ← Red badge
│   └─────────┘    │
│                  │
│  ┌────────────┐  │
│  │Unavailable │  │ ← Gray box instead of time slots
│  │            │  │

---

### 2. **Special Hours Display**
```
┌──────────────────┐
│   Friday         │
│   Nov 03         │
│  ┌──────────────┐ │
│  │Special Hours│ │ ← Amber badge
│  └──────────────┘ │
│                  │
│  ┌──────────────┐ │
│  │09:00 - 13:00│ │ ← Special hours shown
│  └──────────────┘ │
│                  │
│  [09:00] [09:15] │ ← Only slots within special hours
│  [09:30] [09:45] │
│  [10:00] [10:15] │
│  ...             │
└──────────────────┘
```

**Features:**
- Amber "Special Hours" badge
- Special hours time range displayed
- **Only** time slots within the exception hours are available
- Slots outside special hours are **not shown** or **disabled**

---

## 🔧 How It Works (Technical)

### 1. **Fetch Exceptions**
```typescript
// Fetch exceptions when page loads
const { data: exceptionsData } = await supabase
  .from("clinic_exceptions")
  .select("*")
  .eq("clinic_id", clinicId)
  .gte("date", today) // Only future dates
  .order("date");

setExceptions(exceptionsData);
```

---

### 2. **Check for Closed Days**
```typescript
// For each day in calendar
const exception = exceptions.find(ex => ex.date === dayKey);

if (exception && exception.is_closed) {
  // Day is closed - no slots
  slotsMap.set(dayKey, []);
  return;
}
```

**Result:** Closed days show **zero** time slots

---

### 3. **Apply Special Hours**
```typescript
if (exception && !exception.is_closed && exception.time_ranges) {
  // Check if slot time is within any exception time range
  available = !pastSlot && isSlotInExceptionRange(startISO, exception.time_ranges);
}

function isSlotInExceptionRange(slotTime, timeRanges) {
  const slotHourMin = format(slotDate, "HH:mm"); // e.g., "09:30"
  
  return timeRanges.some(range => {
    return slotHourMin >= range.start && slotHourMin < range.end;
  });
}
```

**Example:**
```
Special Hours: 09:00 - 13:00

Slot 08:45 → NOT in range → unavailable
Slot 09:00 → In range → available
Slot 09:15 → In range → available
Slot 12:45 → In range → available
Slot 13:00 → NOT in range (end is exclusive) → unavailable
```

2. Adds exception (e.g., Dec 25 closed)
3. Clicks "Save Exception"
4. Exception saved to database

### When Pet Owner Views Calendar:
1. Pet owner opens booking page for that clinic
2. System fetches exceptions from database
3. Calendar automatically hides/disables slots

**No page reload needed!** Exceptions are fetched on page load.
