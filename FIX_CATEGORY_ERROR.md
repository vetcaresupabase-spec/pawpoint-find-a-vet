# üîß Fix: "Could not find the 'category' column" Error

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem

You're seeing this error:
```
Error creating service
Could not find the 'category' column of 'clinic_services' in the schema cache
```

**Root Cause:** The database migration has NOT been run yet. The `category` column doesn't exist in your `clinic_services` table.

## ‚úÖ THE SOLUTION (Takes 30 seconds)

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to: **https://supabase.com/dashboard**
2. Select your project
3. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run the Migration
1. Click **"New Query"** button
2. Open the file: `RUN_THIS_IN_SUPABASE_SQL_EDITOR.sql` (in your project root)
3. Copy **ALL** contents of that file
4. Paste into the SQL Editor
5. Click **"RUN"** (or press Ctrl+Enter)

### Step 3: Verify Success
You should see:
```
‚úÖ Success. No rows returned
```

And at the bottom, a table showing:
```
clinic_name              | service_count | active_services
-------------------------|---------------|----------------
Happy Paws Veterinary... | 10            | 10
Healthy Pets Clinic...   | 10            | 10
```

### Step 4: Test Again
1. Go back to your Vet Dashboard
2. Click **Services** tab
3. You should now see **10 default services** already created
4. Try adding a new service - it should work now!

## üéØ What the Migration Does

1. ‚úÖ Adds `category` column to `clinic_services` table
2. ‚úÖ Creates 10 default services for EVERY existing clinic
3. ‚úÖ Sets up auto-creation of services for new clinics
4. ‚úÖ Adds proper constraints and permissions

---

## üÜï NEW FEATURE: Auto-Fill Service Name

After running the migration, you'll notice a new behavior:

### How It Works:
1. **Open "Add Service" dialog**
2. **Select a category FIRST** (e.g., "Diagnostics & Imaging")
3. **Service Name auto-fills** with the category name
4. **You can edit** the service name to anything you want
5. Click "Create"

### Example Flow:
```
1. Click "+ Add Service"
2. Select Category: "Diagnostics & Imaging"
   ‚Üí Service Name auto-fills to: "Diagnostics & Imaging"
3. Edit Service Name to: "X-Ray Scan" (or keep it as is)
4. Fill duration, price, etc.
5. Click "Create"
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Service created!
```

### Why This Feature?
- Makes it faster to create services
- Ensures consistency
- You can still customize the name however you want
- Category is now REQUIRED (you must select one)

## üêõ Still Having Issues?

### Error: "relation 'clinic_services' does not exist"
**Solution:** Your database schema is incomplete. Check if the `clinic_services` table exists in Table Editor.

### Error: "permission denied for table clinic_services"
**Solution:** The migration updates RLS policies. Make sure you're logged in as a vet user who owns the clinic.

### Error: "duplicate key value violates unique constraint"
**Solution:** You're trying to add a service with a name that already exists. Each clinic can only have one service with the same name.

### Services still not showing after migration
**Solution:**
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
2. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
3. Logout and login again

## üìÑ Migration File Location

The migration file is located at:
```
pawpoint-find-a-vet/RUN_THIS_IN_SUPABASE_SQL_EDITOR.sql
```

**Important:** You must copy the ENTIRE file. Don't skip any lines!

---

## ‚ú® After Migration Success

Once the migration is complete:

### For Vets:
- ‚úÖ See all 10 default services
- ‚úÖ Add new services with auto-filled names
- ‚úÖ Edit, delete, toggle active/inactive
- ‚úÖ Services appear in pet owner booking immediately

### For Pet Owners:
- ‚úÖ Service dropdown shows all active services
- ‚úÖ Services grouped by 6 categories
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates (new services appear within 5 seconds)

## üéâ Summary

**The Error:** Missing `category` column in database  
**The Fix:** Run the migration in Supabase SQL Editor (30 seconds)  
**The Result:** Services system works + 10 default services created  
**Bonus:** Service names auto-fill from category (but you can edit them!)
