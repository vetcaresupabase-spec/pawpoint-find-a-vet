**Status:** All 4 issues resolved

## Issue 1: Hide "For Vets" Button for Logged-in Pet Owners ✅

**Problem:** When a pet owner was logged in, the "For Vets" navigation link was still visible in the header.

**Solution:**
- Updated `src/components/Header.tsx` to:
  - Track user role (`pet_owner` or `vet`)
  - Only show "For Vets" link if user is NOT logged in OR user is a vet
  - Display user's email address in the Account dropdown button (instead of generic "Account")
  - Route dashboard link based on user role

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Only show "For Vets" link if user is not logged in OR user is a vet
{(!user || userRole === "vet") && (
  <Link to="/for-vets">For Vets</Link>
)}

// Show email in button
<Button size="sm" variant="outline">{user.email}</Button>
```

**Result:** Pet owners no longer see the "For Vets" link when logged in. The header now shows their email address.

## Issue 2: Search Results Not Working ✅

**Problem:** 
- Search page at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/search?petType=dog&location=berlin` wasn't showing clinics
- Clinic cards weren't clickable
- Variable naming mismatch (`vet` vs `c`)

**Solution:**
- Updated `src/pages/SearchResults.tsx` to:
  - Fix variable references (changed `vet` to `c`)
  - Made entire card clickable with `onClick={() => navigate(`/clinic/${c.id}`)}`
  - Added `stopPropagation()` to buttons inside cards to prevent double navigation
  - Display clinic initials instead of broken image references
  - Show verified badge if clinic is verified
  - Updated "Book Appointment" button to navigate to booking page with clinic ID

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Make card clickable
<Card 
  key={c.id} 
  className="hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow cursor-pointer"
  onClick={() => navigate(`/clinic/${c.id}`)}
>

// Book Appointment button
<Button onClick={(e) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
  navigate(`/book-appointment?clinicId=${c.id}`);
}}>
  Book Appointment
</Button>
```

**Result:** 
- Clinics are now displayed correctly on search page
- Clicking anywhere on a card navigates to clinic profile
- Book Appointment button works correctly

---

## Issue 3: Pet Owner Dashboard Not Showing Bookings ✅

**Problem:** Pet Owner Dashboard was showing mock data instead of real bookings from Supabase.

**Solution:**
- Updated `src/pages/PetOwnerDashboard.tsx` to:
  - Use `useQuery` to fetch real bookings from Supabase
  - Query joins with `clinics` and `clinic_services` tables
  - Only show upcoming appointments (future dates)
  - Display loading state while fetching
  - Format dates properly using `date-fns`
  - Show correct status badges (confirmed, pending, canceled, etc.)
  - Handle empty state when no appointments exist

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Fetch user's bookings with joins
const { data: bookings = [], isLoading: bookingsLoading } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["userBookings", user?.id],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from("bookings")
      .select(`
        *,
        clinic:clinics(name, city, address_line1),
        service:clinic_services(name)
      `)
      .eq("pet_owner_id", user.id)
      .gte("appointment_date", format(new Date(), "yyyy-MM-dd"))
      .order("appointment_date", { ascending: true });
    return data || [];
  },
  enabled: !!user?.id,
});
```

**Result:** 
- Pet owners now see their actual bookings from the database
- Appointments show pet name, service, clinic, date, time, and status
- Empty state encourages users to book their first appointment

---

## Issue 4: Book Appointment Button Should Redirect to Search ✅

**Problem:** The "Book Appointment" button in the Pet Owner Dashboard should redirect to the search page so users can find a clinic.

**Solution:**
- Quick action card already had correct navigation: `onClick={() => navigate("/search")}`
- Also updated search results page Book Appointment buttons to redirect to `/book-appointment?clinicId=${clinicId}`
- This creates a proper flow: Dashboard → Search → Clinic Profile → Booking Page

**Result:** 
- "Book Appointment" card redirects to `/search`
- Users can search for clinics and then book directly from search results or clinic profile
