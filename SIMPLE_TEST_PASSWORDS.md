# 🔧 Password Reset Instructions

## The Problem
The vet account passwords may not have been set correctly during creation.

## ✅ Verified Working Account
- **Email:** `lalit@petowner.com`
- **Password:** `lalit@123`
- **Status:** ✅ Has successfully logged in before

## ❌ Problematic Accounts
All vet accounts (`berlin1@vet.com`, etc.) have NEVER logged in successfully, suggesting password issues.

## 🛠️ Solution Options

### Option 1: Manual Password Reset via Supabase Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kfzqslaathiztowisfqd
2. Navigate to: **Authentication** → **Users**
3. Find user: `berlin1@vet.com`
4. Click the **"..."** menu → **Reset Password**
5. Set new password: `TestPass123!`
6. Repeat for other vet accounts

### Option 2: Use Signup Flow

Instead of login, use the "Sign up" tab in the Vet dialog:

1. Go to `/for-vets`
2. Click "Join as a Vet"
3. Click **"Don't have an account? Sign up"**
4. Create NEW account with:
   - Email: `testvet@example.com`
   - Password: `TestPass123!`
5. This will create a fresh account with known password

### Option 3: I Can Create New Test Users

I can create brand new test accounts with guaranteed working passwords using simpler credentials.
